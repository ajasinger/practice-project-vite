// We provided a small React application with some starter code. Your goal is to modify the application so that it displays a 
// tile for every letter in the alphabet in uppercase format. Then if a tile is clicked, that letter is appended to the current 
// string that exists in the element with ID outputString.
// If at any point there are 3 consecutive letters that are the same, replace them with an underscore. 
// For example, if A, B, C, F, F, F, G is clicked in that order, the string that appears in outputString would be ABC_G. 
// If 6 of the same letter appears after, for example, clicking A six times followed by a B, then outputString would be __B.


//Problem: Create a React component that renders a list of user objects. 
//The users have the following properties: id, name, and role. 
//Implement a search input that filters the list by name as the user types. 
//Additionally, add a dropdown to sort the list by role in either ascending or descending order.

//Problem: Create a React component that fetches data from an API (mock the data as a static array if needed) and implements pagination, 
//with the ability to search for specific items in the data. Additionally, allow the user to remove items from the current page without 
//affecting the original data source or pagination structure.

//Build a React component that renders two dropdowns. The second dropdownâ€™s options should depend on the selection made in the first 
//dropdown. When the form is submitted, log the selected values to the console.

//Create a React component that allows the user to input multiple tags (e.g., for categorizing content). 
//Each time the user presses "Enter", the current input should be added as a tag. However, ensure that duplicate tags cannot be added. 
//Display the list of tags below the input field, and allow users to remove tags by clicking on them.

//Create a React component for a simple image carousel. The carousel should show one image at a time with "Next" and "Previous" buttons. 
//Additionally, add buttons below the carousel to allow the user to jump to a specific image by clicking on a dot. 
//The carousel should wrap around when reaching the beginning or end of the image list.
